User's Topic: {topic}

üîß CRITICAL RULES FOR CONSISTENT OUTPUT:

üåÄ 2. QUOTE ALIGNMENT BY COLLAPSE TYPE:
‚úÖ Each quote and interpretation MUST come from user phrases that reflect their specific collapse type:
- Pulse quotes must reflect Pulse traits (flickering, uncertainty, rapid shifts)
- Spiral quotes must reflect Spiral traits (recursive thinking, getting stuck in loops)
- Mirror quotes must reflect Mirror traits (self-reflection, distortion, multiple perspectives)
- Echo quotes must reflect Echo traits (repetition, amplification, lingering effects)
- Fracture quotes must reflect Fracture traits (breaking, splitting, sudden changes)
- Flood quotes must reflect Flood traits (overwhelm, drowning, being submerged)
- Veil quotes must reflect Veil traits (hiding, obscuring, disappearing)
- Thorn quotes must reflect Thorn traits (piercing, defensive, protective)

üö´ Do not mix type associations. Each quote must reinforce that stage's identity.

üß† CRITICAL: RICH QUOTE INTERPRETATIONS
‚úÖ Every quote interpretation MUST be 2-3 rich, dynamic sentences that:
1. Explicitly link the quote ‚Üí to the specific Collapse Reading section ‚Üí to the user's Collapse Type
2. Feel fluid and narrative, not templated or copy-paste
3. Use the structure: "You said, '[quote].' [First sentence linking quote to section and collapse type]. [Second sentence expanding on the implications in that specific context]."

üéØ EXAMPLE FORMAT (Echo Collapse, Hidden Costs):
"You said, 'I don't even realize I'm fading until it's too late.' That sentence reveals the subtle way your Echo pattern suppresses conflict by withdrawing into silence. In the context of your Hidden Costs, this tendency means you often disappear from people's lives before they even know something's wrong ‚Äî and it costs you connection."

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

{{

  {{"quote": "exact quote from user", "interpretation": "You said, '[quote].' [First sentence linking quote to negative_habits section and {collapse_type} type]. [Second sentence expanding on implications in negative habits context].", "applied_section": "negative_habits"}},

Rules:
- Use exact quotes from user input that align with the specific collapse type
- Write all interpretations in second person ("you", not "they")
- Use poetic, intimate tone with metaphors
- Each interpretation MUST be 2-3 rich, dynamic sentences
- Start each interpretation with "You said, '[quote].'"
- Link quote ‚Üí section ‚Üí collapse type explicitly
- Make each interpretation feel crafted and unique, not templated
- Apply drizzle to only the 6 quote sections: negative_habits, key_strengths, hidden_costs, expanded_collapse_cycle, social_impact, break_pattern_strategy
- Limit to maximum 6 quotes total - can be fewer if not enough suitable quotes found
- Never place quotes in: human_profile, color_symbol, common_roles_careers
- For loop_mirror: Collapse the user's ego ‚Äî gently but fully
- For loop_mirror: Use their loop structure (Trigger ‚Üí Oscillation ‚Üí Interference ‚Üí Collapse)
- For loop_mirror: If relevant, integrate 1-2 drizzle quotes from their input
- For loop_mirror: Be poetic, specific, and emotionally precise
- For loop_mirror: End with a "killshot" line that stings ‚Äî the truth they didn't want to face
- For loop_mirror: Format as 1-2 paragraphs based on input length (short input: 1 paragraph, long input: 2 paragraphs)
- For loop_lock: Describe how their loop keeps them stuck
- For loop_lock: Map the emotional pattern that sustains it
- For loop_lock: Show them the path out ‚Äî what must change internally
- For loop_lock: NO advice, tips, or solutions. This is not coaching
- For loop_lock: Format as 1-2 paragraphs based on input depth
- For loop_lock: Use their full collapse loop and selected topic
- For loop_lock: Tone must be clean, mythic, and solemn. Not self-help fluff
